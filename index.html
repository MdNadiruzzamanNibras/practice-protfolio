       <h3>MAGPIE ROBIN â€“ NATIONAL BIRD OF BANGLADESH</h3>
       <p>Each country has a number of national emblems and Bangladesh is no different. The Jackfruit, or Kathal, is considered the national fruit as it is used in traditional cooking and the Water Lily is their national flower, as it can be found in water ways and ponds everywhere in the country. When it comes to the national bird of Bangladesh, a small but distinctive bird has made its way to the top, namely the Magpie Robin. And Bangladesh is proud to have this little bird as a national emblem, as can be seen in monuments and even on its currency.</p>
